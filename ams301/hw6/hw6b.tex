\underline{Problem D}\newline{}
I wish to model the following word problem as a graph problem: The Maytag repairman has been called to repair washers and dryers at several customerâ€™s homes. Assume travel times between locations are known. The repairman starts and ends his day at his home, and would like to complete his work as quickly as possible.\newline{}
(a). What do the nodes of the graph to be constructed represent?\newline{}
The nodes of the graph represent the customers' homes that the repairman needs to visit.\newline{}
(b). What do the edges of the graph to be constructed represent?\newline{}
The edges of the graph represent the trips between the homes. The costs of the edge would represent the travel time of the trips.\newline{} 
(c). State which graph problem it is: Shortest path, Minimum spanning tree, Traveling Salesman Problem,
Breadth or Depth First Search\newline{}
This model is essentially a variation of the Travelling Salesman Problem.\newline{}

\underline{Problem E}\newline{}
For each of the following parts, state True or False. If true, give a short proof. If false, giver a
counterexample. We are given a connected graph G with costs on edges. Assume all costs are positive and
that there are no ties. A, B are nodes in the graph.\newline{}
(1). If an edge e is part of a Minimum Spanning Tree then it cannot be part of a Maximum Spanning Tree. \textit{False. See counterexample below.}\newline{}
(2). If an edge e is part of a Shortest Path Tree rooted at A then it must also be part of a Shortest Path
Tree rooted at B. \textit{False. See counterexample below.}\newline{}
(3). If all edge costs are multiplied by 2 the Shortest Path Tree rooted at A remains the same tree.
\newline{}
\textit{True.} Let $P_1=e_a+e_b+...$ represent a path on the shortest path tree rooted at A. Let $P_2=e_x+e_y+...$ represent any alternative paths on the tree between the two same endpoints. By multiplying all edges on the graph by a positive constant $k$, the cost of those paths. The cost of $P_1'$ is $kP_1=ke_a+ke_b+...$ and the cost of $P_2'$ is $kP_2=ke_x+ke_y+...$ since the constant can be factored out. So the cost of $P_1'$ will still be less than the modified costs of all other paths, meaning all paths will remain part of the new shortest path tree.
\newline{}
(4). An edge e whose cost is the largest in the graph can not be part of a Shortest Path Tree. \textit{False. See counterexample below}\newline{}
